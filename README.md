# Tales from the loop and Things From the Flood



<img src = "img/loop_system.jpg">
This is an implementation of the Tales from the Loop and Things from the Flood game systems for Foundry VTT.

To play Tales from the Loop simply create a kid Character and have fun, for Things from the Flood make that a teen character.  If you want to make the aesthetics of the Things from the Flood system match the style in the books install the companion <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/tftflood/">Things from the Flood Mod</a> from inside the foundry client

This was coded in my spare time over the course a few days so there may be a couple bugs or things that can be improved! 

feedback is always welcome.
